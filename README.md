## Personal Practice Code

Just to have all the codes I write as practice beyond my class. More like personal study. 
This includes codes from several sources:

1. Text book - Starting Out with c++. From Tony Gaddis
2. You Tubes Videos.
3. Power Point presentations from class. 
4. And, any other source I found convinient. 

Therefore much of my code my look deferent from one to another base on the source.
